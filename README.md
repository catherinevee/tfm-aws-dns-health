## üõ†Ô∏è Usage

### Basic Example

```hcl
module "dns_health" {
  source = "./tfm-aws-dns-health"

  name_prefix       = "myapp"
  environment      = "prod"
  primary_endpoint  = "primary-api.example.com"
  backup_endpoint   = "backup-api.example.com"
  
  health_check_type = "HTTPS"
  health_check_port = 443
  health_check_path = "/health"
  
  record_name = "api"
  
  create_hosted_zone = false
  hosted_zone_id     = "Z1234567890ABC"
  
  enable_cloudwatch_alarms = true
  enable_sns_notifications = true
  notification_email       = "ops@example.com"
  
  tags = {
    Project     = "MyApp"
    Environment = "prod"
    Owner       = "DevOps Team"
  }
}
```

### Advanced Example

module "dns_health_advanced" {
  source = "./tfm-aws-dns-health"

  name_prefix       = "critical-app"
  environment      = "prod"
  primary_endpoint  = "primary.example.com"
  backup_endpoint   = "backup.example.com"
  
  # Custom health check settings

    Owner       = "SRE Team"
    CostCenter  = "IT-001"
    Compliance  = "SOX"
  }
}
```

### Simple Example (No Health Checks)

```hcl
module "dns_simple" {
  source = "./tfm-aws-dns-health"

  name_prefix       = "simple-app"
  environment      = "dev"
  primary_endpoint  = "simple.example.com"
  
  # Disable health checks
  enable_health_checks = false
  
  record_name = "simple"
  
  create_hosted_zone = false
  hosted_zone_id     = "Z1234567890ABC"
  
  # Disable monitoring
  enable_cloudwatch_alarms = false
  enable_sns_notifications = false
  
  tags = {
    Project     = "Simple App"
    Environment = "dev"
  }
}
```

## üîç Health Check Types

The module supports the following health check types:

- **HTTP**: Standard HTTP health checks
- **HTTPS**: Secure HTTPS health checks
- **TCP**: TCP connection health checks
- **HTTP_STR_MATCH**: HTTP with string matching
- **HTTPS_STR_MATCH**: HTTPS with string matching
- **CALCULATED**: Calculated health checks
- **CLOUDWATCH_METRIC**: CloudWatch metric-based health checks

## üìä Monitoring & Alerting

### CloudWatch Alarms

The module automatically creates CloudWatch alarms for health check failures:

- **Primary Health Check Alarm**: Triggers when primary endpoint becomes unhealthy
- **Backup Health Check Alarm**: Triggers when backup endpoint becomes unhealthy

### SNS Notifications

Optional SNS topic creation with email subscriptions for:

- Health check failures
- Health check recoveries
- Custom alarm actions

## üîí Security

### IAM Permissions

The following IAM permissions are required:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "route53:CreateHealthCheck",
        "route53:DeleteHealthCheck",
        "route53:GetHealthCheck",
        "route53:UpdateHealthCheck",
        "route53:CreateHostedZone",
        "route53:DeleteHostedZone",
        "route53:GetHostedZone",
        "route53:CreateResourceRecordSet",
        "route53:DeleteResourceRecordSet",
        "route53:GetResourceRecordSet",
        "cloudwatch:PutMetricAlarm",
        "cloudwatch:DeleteAlarms",
        "cloudwatch:DescribeAlarms",
        "sns:CreateTopic",
        "sns:DeleteTopic",
        "sns:Subscribe",
        "sns:Unsubscribe"
      ],
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Encryption

- All health check communications use HTTPS when configured
- SNS topics support encryption at rest
- CloudWatch logs are encrypted by default

## üß™ Testing

### Manual Testing

1. **Health Check Validation**:
   ```bash
   # Test primary endpoint
   curl -I https://primary-api.example.com/health
   
   # Test backup endpoint
   curl -I https://backup-api.example.com/health
   ```

2. **DNS Resolution**:
   ```bash
   # Check DNS resolution
   nslookup api.example.com
   dig api.example.com
   ```

3. **Failover Testing**:
   ```bash
   # Simulate primary failure
   # Verify automatic failover to backup
   ```

### Automated Testing

The module includes example configurations for testing:

```bash
# Navigate to examples
cd examples/basic

# Initialize and plan
terraform init
terraform plan

# Apply (use with caution)
terraform apply
```

## üìà Performance Considerations

- **Health Check Intervals**: Use 30-second intervals for production (10-second for critical systems)
- **Failure Thresholds**: Balance between responsiveness and stability
- **DNS TTL**: Consider lower TTL values for faster failover
- **Monitoring**: Use CloudWatch alarms for proactive monitoring

## üí∞ Cost Optimization

- **Health Check Pricing**: Route 53 health checks are charged per check per month
- **CloudWatch Alarms**: Standard CloudWatch pricing applies
- **SNS Notifications**: Pay per message delivered
- **Hosted Zones**: Monthly charge per hosted zone

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Health Check Failures**:
   - Verify endpoint accessibility
   - Check firewall rules
   - Validate health check path

2. **DNS Resolution Issues**:
   - Confirm hosted zone configuration
   - Verify name server delegation
   - Check record propagation

3. **CloudWatch Alarm Issues**:
   - Validate alarm configuration
   - Check SNS topic permissions
   - Verify email subscription

### Debug Commands

```bash
# Check health check status
aws route53 get-health-check --health-check-id <health-check-id>

# Verify DNS records
aws route53 list-resource-record-sets --hosted-zone-id <zone-id>

# Check CloudWatch alarms
aws cloudwatch describe-alarms --alarm-names <alarm-name>
```
